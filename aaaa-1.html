       <hr > <marquee class="rethu" ><font face="regular" size="5" scroll amount="80" color="blue"  >Life is either a daring adventure or nothing. 
            Life is a long lesson in humility. 
            In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on. 
            You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
            Life is made of ever so many partings welded together. 
            Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€” which is living with the results of other people's thinking. -Steve Jobs
            Life is trying things to see if they work. 
            So</font></marquee><hr>
